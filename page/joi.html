        <h2>Digital reflection tool for Child Protection social workers</h2>
        <h6>Problem statement</h6>
        <p>The mounting workload faced by child protection social workers has severely limited their opportunities for self-reflection. The current reflective tools, notably the use of booklet paper forms (referred to as case notes) during supervisions, prove to be time-consuming and lack the depth needed for insightful analysis. Unfortunately, due to the current high-demand workload, prioritizing reflective practices has become a challenge.</p>
        <h6>Solution</h6>
        <p>Joi offers valuable insights to child protection social workers by engaging in consultations with families, facilitating rapid and insightful reflection on their actions. This is achieved through an innovative application that allows the recording of audio clips and employs sensors, such as smartwatches, to measure stress levels during counseling sessions. The gathered data equips social workers to provide prompt input during supervisions with colleagues, supervisors, or experts, enhancing the overall effectiveness of their professional discussions.</p>

            <p>The user wears a smartwatch during recordings. The smartwatch
              measures stressmoments during a counsel to quickly gain insights. It measures through sensors in the
              smartwatch, using heart rhythm variation.

          <h3>Target group</h3>
          <p>Social workers specialized in child protection (CP social workers) are responsible for helping broken
            families. They map out where the bottlenecks within the family lies and seeks for the right help. Their goal
            is ensuring welfare and wellbeing of the children.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="alinea">
          <h3>Interview insights</h3>
          <p>Through prior desk research we discovered that CP social workers have several tools including reflecting
            tools they apply on their job. Here are the insights about CP social workers:
            <ul class="bulletpoints">
              <li>The current tools they apply are seen as time consuming and outdated</li>
              <li>High demanded workload holds them back to reflect. The wellbeing and care for the children are higher
                prioritized
                then personal development</li>
              <li>The intrinsic motivation is that they're driven and passionate about their job</li>
              <li>To be able to reflect properly, its most effective to analyze through voice recordings or videos</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="alinea">
          <h3>Benefits of reflecting</h3>
          <p>In order to develop in their workfield, CP social workers reflect on their actions after events. These
            events
            consist of supervisions or counsels with families. Reflection allows them to plan, articulate, evaluate
            and learn in the complex issues that they face daily. The importance of reflecting, is to breakdown and
            critically analyze the processes that occur in decision making in child protection. This leads to develop a
            sense of what has achieved, what is likely to be achieved and could be done better. Resulting to provide
            better help for the child and the family.</p>

          <p>How can I help CP social workers gaining insights on their learning points through a digital interactive
            application, in order to efficiently take care of their development process. As a result, knowing what to
            tackle in their own development.</p>

          <p>Reflecting by using only text input seems ineffective, since you have to go through every highlight looking
            for that specific note. Instead of text input, provide the user with measurable values like numbers or
            emoticons.</p>

          <p>Main colors in the brand identity of Jeugdbescherming van Amsterdam are red and orange. The color palette
            is implemented to emphasize some components in the application such as buttons
            and icons.
            I kept the icons simple and recognizible. For typography I chose for sans-serif to fit the professional
            environment and to compensate the somewhat playful color palette.</p>

          <h6>End result</h6>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>After conducted tests, iterations and more tests, I discovered that the technique behind the concept seemed
            harder
            to realise than examined. There were some questionmarks about the heart rythm variation. One test showed
            there's a possible chance that the measures can deviate, because high tensions do not always define a
            troubled situation. Despite the hard realisation of the technique, the tests and validation proved that the
            concept indeed can raise
            the ability for CP social workers to start reflecting structurally.</p>
